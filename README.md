For running this code :

First you need to install virtual environment in the particular directory you desired.
For installation type the command in the command prompt: py -3 -m virtualenv virtualenv
Now virtual environment is installed. A folder is created in that respective directory. Copy all the files in the zip-file you download and paste them in that folder
which has a virtualenv folder.
In the command prompt go to the directory where all the files with code are there and type virtualenv\scripts\activate to activate the virtual environment

Please make sure that all the requirements in the requirements.txt file are installed prior to the running of the code by using pip commands.

What this application does?

In this hospital management system first the new patient details with the type of bed they needed are to be created and a patient id
is generated and with the help of patient id we can edit and update some of the patients details. we can delete the patient details
and we can search for a patient and also we can see the list of all the patients who are not yet Discharged.

we can add the medicines used for the patient and also the tests conducted for the patient.

finally we can generate the final bill for the patient before his Discharge.

****PS:  The medicines and the diagnostics tests are updated by the stock maintenance executive hence no option to enter them is given ****
