In this hospital management system first the new patient details with the type of bed they needed are to be created and a patient id
is generated and with the help of patient id we can edit and update some of the patients details. we can delete the patient details
and we can search for a patient and also we can see the list of all the patients who are not yet Discharged.

we can add the medicines used for the patient and also the tests conducted for the patient.

finally we can generate the final bill for the patient before his Discharge.

****PS:  The medicines and the diagnostics tests are updated by the stock maintenance executive hence no option to enter them is given ****
